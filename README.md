## To do

* Enhance the notification panel w/ player specific informations (color when specific to user) and colored icon (click/open to back to normal)
* Create more fun maps and with more players
* When a (real) player passes its tur, check that he is not lazy
* Add some sounds: player turn, barricade captured, move error, etc.
* Migrate the board UI from DOM to CANVAS
* Create a zoomable board: + and - buttons (within controls panel?)
